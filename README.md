### History of Neural Networks
Although the study of human brain is thousands of years old, the first step towards Neural Networks (NN) took place in 1943 When a Neural Physiologist Warran McCulloc & the mathematician Walter Pitts wrote a paper on how neurons might work. They modeled a simple neural network with electrical circuits. In 1949 Donald Hebb reinforced the concept of neurons in his book, The organization of Behavior. It shed lights on the fact that neural pathways are strengthened each time they are used. In 1957 John von Neumann suggested imitating simple neuron functions using telegraph relays or vacuum tubes. In 1959, Bernard Widrow & Marcian Hoff of Stanford University developed models called ADALINE and MADALINE; the first neural network to be applied to a real-world problem. In 1970, the first version of the back-propagation algorithm (Also called the reverse mode of automatic differentiation) was developed and published by a Finnish master student Seppo Linnainmaa.  Until 1981, progress on neural network research halted due to fear and unfulfilled claims, etc.  In 1982, John Hopfield presented a paper to the national Academy of Sciences. Additionally, in the same year, during the US-Japan joint Conference on Cooperative / Competitive Neural Networks; Japan announced their 5th generation effort resulted in US worrying about being behind and restarted the funding in the US. In 1985, American Institute of Physics began what has become an annual meeting – Neural Networks for Computing.  In 1998, Yann LeCun used the concept of backpropagation and published Gradient-Based Learning Applied to Document Recognition. Today, Neural Networks discussions are prevalent, and the concepts are applied in a plethora of fields such as text recognition, computer vision, etc.
